### Types of Data

- **Semi-Structured Data** is data that neither adheres to the formal structure of data model as in conventional database systems, nor it is raw.
- It contains tags or other markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and fields within the data.
- Semi-Structured data includes XML, JSON.

Notes:
- Merrill Lynch cited a rule of thumb that somewhere around 80-90% of all potentially usable business information may originate in unstructured form
- IDC and EMC project that data will grow to 40 zettabytes by 2020, resulting in a 50-fold growth from the beginning of 2010.
- Computer World states that unstructured information might account for more than 70%â€“80% of all data in organizations

- Data with some form of structure may still be characterized as unstructured if its structure is not helpful for the processing task at hand.
- Unstructured information might have some structure (semi-structured) or even be highly structured but in ways that are unanticipated or unannounced.
